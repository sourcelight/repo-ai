Build a RESTful API for a simple social media application using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL. The application should allow users to create and view posts, follow other users, and like posts. Each post should have a title, body, and author. Use Hibernate to persist the post and user data in the database.
Please provide a set of technologies and frameworks required to develop such an application.
Create a list of tasks with examples of prompts I can ask you for each task to get relevant examples.

To build a RESTful API for a simple social media application using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL, you will need the following technologies and frameworks:

### Technologies and Frameworks Required:

1. **Spring Boot** - For building the RESTful API.
2. **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)** - For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
3. **PostgreSQL** - As the relational database to store user and post data.
4. **Spring Security** - For user authentication and authorization (optional but recommended).
5. **Thymeleaf or any other template engine** - If you decide to serve web pages, though RESTful API typically serves JSON data.
6. **Maven or Gradle** - For project management and dependency management.
7. **Lombok** - To reduce boilerplate code for common entity/model functionalities.
8. **Swagger** - For API documentation and testing.
9. **JUnit and Mockito** - For unit and integration testing.

when running tests I get the following error
"""
 drop table if exists user cascade " via JDBC [Syntax error in SQL statement "\000d\000a    drop table if exists [*]user cascade "; expected "identifier";]
"""

The issue you’re facing is due to the use of a reserved keyword, `user`, in your SQL statements. In PostgreSQL (and many other SQL databases), `user` is a reserved keyword.

To fix this, you should escape the table name. In PostgreSQL, this can be done by enclosing the identifier in double quotes, like `"user"`. However, a more common practice is to avoid using reserved keywords as table names and use a more descriptive name, such as `app_user`.

### Solution 1: Escaping Table Name

Modify your entity class to use the escaped table name:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "\"user\"")
public class User {
    // fields, getters, setters, etc.
}
```

### Solution 2: Rename the Table

A more robust solution is simply to give the table a different name that’s not a reserved keyword. This avoids the need for escaping throughout your codebase.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "app_user")
public class User {
    // fields, getters, setters, etc.
}
```

### Updating Repository interfaces

If you’re using Spring Data JPA, ensure the repository interfaces still refer to the correct entity:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // repository methods
}
```

### Drop Table Script

If you are dropping tables manually, make sure your drop table script also accounts for the proper naming:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "user" CASCADE;
```

### Updating Test Configurations

Make sure your test configurations also use the correct table name, whether escaped or renamed:

```properties
# application-test.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdb
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
```

### Running Tests with Correct Schema

Ensure your tests are running with the correct schema:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class UserServiceTests {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Test
    public void testCreateUser() {
        User user = new User();
        user.setUsername("testuser");
        user.setPassword("testpass");
        userRepository.save(user);

        assertNotNull(userRepository.findByUsername("testuser"));
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the SQL syntax error related to the reserved keyword problem.
